/* App.css - Component-specific styles for App.jsx */
/* 
 * This file is intentionally empty.
 * 
 * The project uses Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI components for all styling.
 * All styles are applied via utility classes directly in components.
 * 
 * If component-specific styles are needed for App.jsx in the future,
 * they can be added here without conflicting with the Tailwind setup.
 * 
 * Previous Vite demo styles were removed to prevent layout conflicts
 * with the custom Container component and full-width design.
